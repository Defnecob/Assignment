## Based on the exercises from Rajbir: [here](https://github.com/CompEpigen/BasicR/blob/master/markdown/Day3_3_MulitivariableRegression_Exercise.Rmd)

7. Use the hfi dataset from the `openintro` package

8. Fit a new model that uses  `pf_expression_control` to predict `hf_score`, or the total human freedom score.
9. Again add region to the model from Q4. Compare the slope and $R^2$ with the model from Q4.

10. Finally fit a model with `ef_money` and `pf_expression_control` as exposures and `hf_score` as outcome.  Compare the slope and $R^2$ from the models from Q1. Could `ef_money` be a confounder? 

11. Use a linear regression model (and scatter plot) with  `ef_money` as exposure and `pf_expression_control` as outcome, to study whether `ef_money` has an association with `pf_expression_control` as well. This might validate our finding that `ef_money` is a confounder between  `pf_expression_control` as exposure and 
`hf_score` as outcome from Q6.

## Getting Started
```{r}

install.packages("workflowr")
library("workflowr")

wflow_git_config(user.name = "Defnecob", user.email = "Cobanoglu@stud.uni-heidelberg.de", overwrite=TRUE)

wflow_start("Assignment", existing = TRUE)

```

### Load packages
```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}

install.packages("openintro")
library(openintro)
library(broom)
library(tidyverse)
```

### The data

Exercise 7:

```{r}
hfi_2016 <- hfi %>% 
  filter(year == 2016)

head(hfi_2016)
```



------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 8:

```{r echo=TRUE}
model1 <- lm(hf_score ~ pf_expression_control, data = hfi_2016)

tidy(model1) 
```
```{r echo=TRUE}
summarise(hfi_2016, correlation_hf_pf = cor(pf_expression_control, hf_score))

#Tells us that the correlation between expression_control and human freedom is 0.7931748
#And that the intercept estimate is 5.053396 and the slope is 0.368432, this suggests that for every increase in pf_expression_control per unit, the human freedom increases by 0.368432
```

```{r}
slope1 <- model1$coefficients["pf_expression_control"]
slope1

```

Exercise 9:

```{r}
model2<- lm(hf_score ~ pf_expression_control + region, data = hfi_2016)

tidy(model2) 


```

the slope between human freedom and expression control decreased to 0.27471091 in comparison to 0.368432 in the previous model without regions, so that the finluence of pf_expression control also decreased


```{r}
slope2 <- model2$coefficients["pf_expression_control"]
slope2
```


```{r}
glance(model1) 
```

```{r}
rsquared1 <- summary(model1)$r.squared

rsquared1 

```
```{r}
glance(model2) 
```


```{r}
rsquared2 <- summary(model2)$r.squared

rsquared2
```

the r.squared with the model1 is 0.6291262	and with the model2 including region is 0.7544951
so the r.squared value is increasing in the second model suggesting more variability in the hf score

Exercsie 10:


```{r}
model3 <- lm(hf_score ~ ef_money, data = hfi_2016)
model4<- lm(hf_score ~ pf_expression_control + ef_money, data = hfi_2016)

```




```{r}
tidy(model3)
glance(model3)
```
```{r}
tidy(model4)
glance(model4)
```


```{r}
slope3 <- model3$coefficients["ef_money"]
slope3

```

```{r}
slope4 <- model4$coefficients["ef_money"]
slope4
```

```{r}
rsquared3 <- summary(model3)$r.squared
rsquared3
```


```{r}
rsquared4 <- summary(model4)$r.squared
rsquared4
```

From comparing slope3 and slope4 one can tell that the additional exposure to hf_score and ef_money leads to an decrease in the ef_money slope from 0.504 to 0.352 

When looking at the rsquared value: it increase from 0.425 to 0.756 indicating that ef_money can be a confounder

-> for identifying cofounders, a change in percentage of from one model to the other is required to be > 10% which is the case here, thus suggesting ef_money being a confounder

In general, when combining the variables the variance doesn't increase as much as expected


Exercise 11:

```{r}

#for model5: pf_expression control as outcome, ef_money as exposures

model5 <- lm(pf_expression_control ~ ef_money + region, data = hfi_2016)


summary(model5)

```

```{r}
tidy(model5)
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = hfi_2016, aes(x = ef_money, y = pf_expression_control))+ 
  geom_point(colour="darkgreen") + 
  ggtitle(label="Linear regression model with ef_money and pf_expression_control")+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  theme(
  panel.border = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
  panel.background=element_blank(),
  axis.line = element_line(colour = "grey")
  )


```

This scatterplot shows that ef_money is a confounder between pf_expression_control as exposure and hf_score as outcome.
